# **My Education**

## HighSchool
I attended [Spokane High School](https://www.spokane.k12.mo.us/530962_3) in Spokane, Missouri. I have always placed academics above everything else, and becuase of such I graduated high school with a 4.14 and Honors. While I did focus on my academics a majority of the time, I was also apart of multiple teams and clubs including:

* Cross Country
* Track
* The Honors Society
* Future Community Career Leaders of America
* Student Council
* Scholar Bowl

## College
I currently attend the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/) in Columbia, Missouri. Still placing my academics above all else I am apart of the Honors College. With classroom performance being much more important than it was in high school, I am no longer apart of any teams or clubs besides the Honors College.
